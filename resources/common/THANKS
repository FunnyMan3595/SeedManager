Special thanks to:
* I don't now, for providing graphics that look nice
* Many people on the IC2 forums, for providing me with instructions for and
  examples of porting SeedManager to MCPC Bukkit.
  (You know who you are, and I'm sorry that it didn't go official before
   cpw made the entire idea obsolete.)
* narc0tiq, for pair programming, debugging aid, and the first draft of
  mcmod.info
